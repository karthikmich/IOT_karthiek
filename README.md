Hi Everyone my name is Karthik Gorantla

# MOTIVATION 

I did my bachelor's in the stream of Information Technology. I’ve worked as a senior software engineer at Accenture for around 3 years. I would like to enhance my skills by representing my observations and logics of IoT experiments in this repository. I also like to gather latest informations and latest technology news related to IoT and post in this repository. My main intention is to provide github users a clear idea of I0T experiments.
